# Green River

The UI for an upcoming money tracking application.

## Primary Objective

The primary purpose of this application is to track the flow of my money so that I can better see my financial situation.

## Secondary Objective

The second objective is to practice CSS.  While I could use an existing CSS framework like Material UI, Bootstrap, or Semantic UI, or insert-your-favorite-framework-or-library-here, CSS is a skill that I am sorely lacking and relying on a framework isn't going to increase my knowledge of it any time soon.  Does it make my development faster?  Most definitely.  Will it magically improve my CSS skills?  Not so much.  I still love them, though :blue_heart:
